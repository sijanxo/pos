# Quantity Input Field Bug Fix

## Problem Description

The quantity input field in `src/app/sales/page.tsx` was changed from uncontrolled (`defaultValue`) to controlled (`value`), but the existing `onChange` handler did not properly update the state for all input changes. This prevented users from:

- Clearing the field completely
- Typing intermediate invalid values (like empty strings)
- Having a smooth editing experience

The input would immediately revert to its previous value, making it impossible to clear and type new quantities.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the controlled input implementation at lines 247-258. The original code:

```javascript
<input
  type="text"
  value={item.quantity}  // Controlled by React state
  onChange={(e) => {
    const value = parseInt(e.target.value, 10)
    if (!isNaN(value) && value >= 1) {
      updateQuantity(item.id, value)
    }
    // If validation fails, state doesn't update, so input reverts
  }}
/>
```

The problem was that when users tried to clear the field or enter intermediate values, the validation would fail, the state wouldn't update, and React would immediately revert the input to the previous valid value.

## Solution

Implemented a dual-state approach:

1. **Local editing state**: Tracks what the user is currently typing
2. **Persistent quantity state**: The actual quantity value stored in the cart

### Key Changes

1. **Added editing state tracking**:
   ```javascript
   const [editingQuantity, setEditingQuantity] = useState<Record<string, string>>({})
   ```

2. **Updated input value logic**:
   ```javascript
   value={editingQuantity[item.id] !== undefined ? editingQuantity[item.id] : item.quantity.toString()}
   ```

3. **Improved onChange handler**:
   - Always updates the local editing state to show user input
   - Only updates actual quantity when input is valid
   - Allows empty strings and intermediate values during typing

4. **Added proper focus/blur handling**:
   - `onFocus`: Initializes editing state
   - `onBlur`: Validates and finalizes input, clears editing state
   - `onKeyDown`: Handles Enter key to finalize input

5. **Enhanced user experience**:
   - Users can now clear the field completely
   - Typing feels natural and responsive
   - Invalid values are handled gracefully
   - Enter key finalizes the input

## Result

- ✅ Users can clear the quantity field
- ✅ Smooth typing experience without input reverting
- ✅ Proper validation still maintained
- ✅ No loss of existing functionality
- ✅ Better UX with Enter key support

The fix maintains all existing validation logic while providing a much better user experience for editing quantities.
