# Sales History List Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Sales History List into the top-level Reports page as requested. The implementation includes a fully functional sales history display with clickable items that show detailed receipt information in a modal.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `src/components/SalesHistoryList.tsx` (New)
- **Purpose**: Display sales history data from the SalesContext/store
- **Features**:
  - Table layout showing Sale ID, Date, Cashier, Total Amount, and Payment Method
  - Clickable rows that open receipt details in a modal
  - Empty state handling when no sales data exists
  - Responsive design with hover effects
  - Modal overlay with receipt display integration

### 2. `src/app/reports/page.tsx` (Modified)
- **Purpose**: Top-level reports page integration
- **Changes**:
  - Imported and integrated the SalesHistoryList component
  - Added sample data generation for testing purposes
  - Implemented automatic sample data initialization
  - Added user instructions and manual sample data generation button
  - Replaced placeholder content with functional sales history display

## Key Features Implemented

### Sales History Display
- ✅ **Sale ID**: Displays unique sale identifier
- ✅ **Date**: Formatted date/time using `formatDateTime()` utility
- ✅ **Cashier**: Shows cashier ID from sale data
- ✅ **Total Amount**: Properly formatted currency using `formatCurrency()` utility
- ✅ **Payment Method**: Displays payment method (cash/card)

### Interactive Features
- ✅ **Clickable Rows**: Each sale entry is clickable
- ✅ **Modal Receipt Display**: Opens `ReceiptDisplay` component in modal
- ✅ **Modal Close**: Close button and click-outside-to-close functionality
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes

### Data Integration
- ✅ **SalesContext Integration**: Uses `useSalesHistory()` hook from `SalesStore`
- ✅ **Sample Data**: Generates realistic sample sales data for testing
- ✅ **Automatic Loading**: Populates sample data when no existing sales found
- ✅ **Manual Generation**: Button to manually generate sample data

## Sample Data Structure
Created three sample sales with realistic data:
1. **Sale 1**: 3 days ago, $89.99, Card payment, Wine & Vodka
2. **Sale 2**: 1 day ago, $45.99, Cash payment with discount, Beer & Wine
3. **Sale 3**: Today, $129.99, Card payment, Whisky & Wine

## Navigation Integration
- ✅ **Navigation Link**: The existing navigation already points to `/reports`
- ✅ **Route Setup**: Uses Next.js App Router at `src/app/reports/page.tsx`
- ✅ **Access Control**: Respects existing `useCanAccess('reports')` permissions
