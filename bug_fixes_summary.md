# Bug Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues in `handleCompleteSale` Function

### Bug 1: Flat Cart Discount Calculation
**Problem**: The cart discount calculation within `handleCompleteSale` was using the global `cartDiscountAmount` variable directly, which could potentially lead to inconsistent discount calculations and negative final totals if the discount exceeded the subtotal.

**Fix**: 
- Added explicit discount calculation within `handleCompleteSale` that ensures flat cart discounts are properly capped using `Math.min(cartDiscount.amount, subtotalAmount)`
- This prevents discounts from exceeding the subtotal amount
- Also added `Math.max(0, appliedCashPayment - totalAmount)` to ensure change given is never negative

```typescript
// Before
const discountInCents = toCents(cartDiscountAmount);
const changeGivenInCents = selectedPaymentMethod === 'cash' ? toCents(appliedCashPayment - totalAmount) : 0;

// After  
const cappedCartDiscountAmount = cartDiscount 
  ? cartDiscount.type === 'flat' 
    ? Math.min(cartDiscount.amount, subtotalAmount)
    : subtotalAmount * (cartDiscount.amount / 100)
  : 0;
const discountInCents = toCents(cappedCartDiscountAmount);
const changeGivenInCents = selectedPaymentMethod === 'cash' ? toCents(Math.max(0, appliedCashPayment - totalAmount)) : 0;
```

### Bug 2: Payment Method Determination & Validation
**Problem**: The payment validation logic was insufficient:
- Card transactions could complete without any payment validation
- Missing validation for payment method selection
- Insufficient payment checks for cash transactions

**Fix**:
- Enhanced `canCompleteTransaction` logic to require payment method selection and proper validation for both cash and card payments
- Added comprehensive payment validation within `handleCompleteSale` function
- Added explicit error messages for invalid payment states

```typescript
// Before
const canCompleteTransaction = 
  cartItems.length > 0 && (
    (selectedPaymentMethod === 'cash' && remainingBalance <= 0) ||
    (selectedPaymentMethod === 'card')
  );

// After
const canCompleteTransaction = 
  cartItems.length > 0 && selectedPaymentMethod !== null && (
    (selectedPaymentMethod === 'cash' && remainingBalance <= 0) ||
    (selectedPaymentMethod === 'card' && totalAmount > 0)
  );
```

**Additional Validation Added**:
- Check for payment method selection
- Validate sufficient cash payment
- Validate valid transaction total for card payments
- Proper error messaging for each validation failure

## Impact
These fixes ensure:
1. Cart discounts cannot create negative totals or invalid discount amounts
2. All transactions require proper payment validation before completion
3. Better error handling and user feedback for invalid payment states
4. Consistent discount calculations throughout the application
